# js-rock-paper-scissors

I used this exercise to brush up on my JS fundamentals. While it was a bit below my ability levels, it was worthwile practice at organization and architecture.

Later on, I returned to this and added in a simple web UI. Doing so was a good way to get more comfortable manipulating the DOM with vanilla JavaScript, and it reinforced by understanding of building functional webpages.
